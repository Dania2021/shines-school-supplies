# Shines School Supplies

Shines School Suplies is a full stack e-commerce website built using Django, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website utilises Stripe as the payment processor.

This version has been built for project 5 of the Code Institute Diploma in Software Development and therefore doesn't accept real payments and any orders made won't be fulfilled.

If you would like to test the payment functionality please feel free to do so by entering the card details below when prompted:

Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242  Exp: any future date eg. 11/26 CVC: any 3 digits eg 123
